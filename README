This directory contains the sources for the pwdutils. This is a collection
of utilities to manage the passwd information stored in local files, NIS,
NIS+ or LDAP and can replace the shadow suite complete.

You need to create a certificate with
 openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 730 -out /etc/rpasswdd.pem \
	-keyout /etc/rpasswdd.pem
for the rpasswd daemon.
